These are based on the [knaus_talon](https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon) Talon user file set (see [the earlier section](#install-a-talon-user-file-set)). These commands may vary depending on your individual setup.\\n\\n\\n### Command history\\n\\n`command history`\\n: Toggles the command history display, which shows the last few commands as Talon understood them; if you're not sure what Talon is doing, or if it understood you correctly, this is how to check it.\\n\\n\\n### Show available comands\\n\\n`knausj_talon` has an integrated help.  It can show you a list of all defined commands, or just all commands that are available now.\\n\\n`help alphabet`\\n: show the spelling alphabet for pressing individual keys\\n\\n`help context`\\n: show all defined commands\\n\\n`help active`\\n: show all currently available commands\", metadata={'source': '/Users/qinliao/learn/wiki/basic_usage.md'}), Document(page_content=\"The next key component is the implementation of behaviour via [Actions](/unofficial_talon_docs#actions). Two examples are moving the mouse cursor and pasting the contents of the clipboard. Talon comes with some built in actions, but most are defined and implemented in user scripts.\\n\\nOne of the primary modes of input to Talon is through voice commands defined in `.talon` files. To implement commands containing dynamic 'variables' (e.g. 'allcaps some arbitrary words') you can utilize [Lists](/unofficial_talon_docs#lists) and [Captures](/unofficial_talon_docs#captures).\\n\\nIn addition to the above we also have the concept of [Settings](/unofficial_talon_docs#settings). Built-in and custom settings are used by actions to configure their behaviour (e.g. to change the delay between key presses in the `insert()` action).\\n\\nThe final concept is the Module.

The `.py` files may indeed be a little difficult to work with in the beginning, however `.talon` files are designed to be simple and to provide good feedback if you make mistakes. We'll provide some explanation for working with `.talon` files on this page. More extensive documentation about both `.talon` and `.py` files can be found at [unofficial talon docs](/unofficial_talon_docs).\\n\\n## Managing your customizations\\n\\nTalon is built to be a flexible and customizable system. This means that in addition to being able to add new voice commands you can also override the behavior of existing commands reasonably easily.\\n\\nGiven this flexibility there are two ways you could approach customizing your Talon setup:\\n\\n* Option A: Edit the `.talon` and `.py` files within the knausj\\\\_talon directory.\\n* Option B: Maintain your own separate directory with your customizations.\", metadata={'source': '/Users/qinliao/learn/wiki/basic_customization.md'}), Document(page_content=\"When setting up Talon to respond to voice commands you would have installed some existing user file sets (probably `knausj_talon`) in to your Talon `user` directory (e.g. `~/.talon/user/` in Linux/MacOS). All of your Talon configuration/scripts go in this `user` directory and are formatted as either Talon (`.talon`) or Python (`.py`) files.\\n\\nTalon doesn't care what names you give your `.py` or `.talon` files, or what folders you put them into; it will automatically try to load everything inside your `user` folder when it starts up. Any folders or file names you see in Talon user file sets (e.g. `knausj_talon`) were chosen by the authors of that package. Talon also monitors files in the `user` directory, and will automatically reload them if they're changed (printing a [log message](/unofficial_talon_docs#repl-and-logging)). This reloading is convenient when working on scripts/configuration as you generally don't have to restart Talon for it to pick up changes.\", metadata={'source': '/Users/qinliao/learn/wiki/unofficial_talon_docs.md'}), Document(page_content='All customization consists of files with `.talon` or `.py` file extensions placed in the Talon user directory. The Talon user directory is where you put the knausj\\\\_talon Talon user file set (\"~/.talon/user/\" on MacOS/Linux, \"%APPDATA%\\\\Talon\\\\user\" on Windows). Talon doesn\\'t care how you organize your files within this directory, any subdirectories or file names are just there to make things easier to understand for you and others.\\n\\nSo why do we have two kinds of configuration/scripting files (`.py` and `.talon`)? Roughly speaking `.talon` files provide a succinct way of mapping spoken commands to behaviour. `.py` files on the other hand provide the implementation of behaviour and other functionality used by `.talon` files. `.py` files are written in the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) (one of the most popular programming languages in the world). `.talon` files are written in a language that is only used by Talon.', metadata={'source': '/Users/qinliao/learn/wiki/basic_customization.md'})]}\u001b[0m\n",
