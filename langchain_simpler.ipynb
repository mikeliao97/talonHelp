Two examples are moving the mouse cursor and pasting the contents of the clipboard. Talon comes with some built in actions, but most are defined and implemented in user scripts.\\n\\nOne of the primary modes of input to Talon is through voice commands defined in `.talon` files. To implement commands containing dynamic 'variables' (e.g. 'allcaps some arbitrary words') you can utilize [Lists](/unofficial_talon_docs#lists) and [Captures](/unofficial_talon_docs#captures).\\n\\nIn addition to the above we also have the concept of [Settings](/unofficial_talon_docs#settings). Built-in and custom settings are used by actions to configure their behaviour (e.g. to change the delay between key presses in the `insert()` action).\\n\\nThe final concept is the Module.

Any folders or file names you see in Talon user file sets (e.g. `knausj_talon`) were chosen by the authors of that package. Talon also monitors files in the `user` directory, and will automatically reload them if they're changed (printing a [log message](/unofficial_talon_docs#repl-and-logging)). This reloading is convenient when working on scripts/configuration as you generally don't have to restart Talon for it to pick up changes.\", metadata={'source': '/Users/qinliao/learn/wiki/unofficial_talon_docs.md'}), Document(page_content='All customization consists of files with `.talon` or `.py` file extensions placed in the Talon user directory.
